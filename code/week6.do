 - TOPIC:  Opposition to Torture in Israel
 
 - DATA:   European Social Survey Round 4 (2008)
 
   This do-file introduces the topic of significance tests, i.e. statistical
   tools to assess whether an association that shows up in the data is different
   from the kind of arrangement that might be observed in random data.
   
   Associations are relationships between two of your variables. They correspond
   to real-world relationships, like the association between income and gender.
   Significance tests are helpful to observe and measure these phenomena.
   
   The null hypothesis, which is the kind of hypothesis that gets tested in a 
   significance test, is different from the substantive hypotheses that you 
   previously formulated about your data. It is usually denoted "H_0".
   
   The null hypothesis is the extent to which it is possible to reproduce the
   association that you observe in the data by statistical accident. It measures
   the consistency of your data with randomness.
   
   A significance test never proves anything. It can only reject the possibility
   that an association in your data is consistent with accidental situations.
   The aim of a significance test is therefore to reject the null hypothesis.
   
   To obtain that kind of proof by contradiction, the significance test will
   estimate how likely it is to reach the same kind of association that you
   observe from random data. This likelihood is called the p-value of the test.
   
   A small p-value means that is highly unlikely to produce the same association
   as the one you observe out of randomness. Note how far that result is from an
   assessment of whether your hypothesis is right or wrong!
   
   The notions covered in the paragraphs above cannot be introduced technically,
   as short comments accompanying Stata commands. They require that you actually
   open your textbooks and read at length about statistical estimation.
   
   There are many different kinds of hypothesis tests: we will cover the t-test,
   the proportions test, the Chi-squared test and finally linear correlation.
   The Stata Guide also covers these tests. Make sure to read what you need to!

* Load ESS dataset, Round 4.
use data/ess0816 if essround == 4, clear

* Technical step: delete a variable that should not be there.
cap drop _merge

* Survey weights.
svyset [pw = dweight] // weighting scheme set to country-specific population

* Rename variables to short handles.
renvars agea gndr hinctnta eduyrs \ age sex income edu // socio-demographics
renvars rlgdnm lrscale tvpol \ denom pol tv            // religion, politics

* Have a quick look.
codebook cntry age sex income edu denom pol tv, c

* Inspect religious variables further.
tab denom rlgblg, miss nolab

* Add non-religious to denominations.
replace denom = 0 if rlgblg == 2

* Append the value label accordingly.
la de rlgdnm 0 "Not religious", add


* Subsetting
* ----------

* Check how much data is missing.
misstable pat cntry age sex income edu denom pol tv

* Delete incomplete observations.
drop if mi(age, sex, income, edu, denom, pol, tv)


* Dependent variable: Justifiability of torture in event of preventing terrorism
* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

fre trrtort

* Generate dummies called 'torture_1 torture_2' etc. for each DV category.
tab trrtort, gen(torture_)

* Country-level breakdown using stacked bars and 5-pt scale graph scheme.
gr hbar torture_? [aw = dweight], stack ///
	over(cntry, sort(1)des lab(labsize(*.8))) ///
    yti("Torture is never justified even to prevent terrorism") ///
    legend(rows(1) ///
    order(1 "Strongly agree" 2 "" 3 "Neither" 4 "" 5 "Strongly disagree")) ///
    name(torture1, replace) scheme(burd5)

* Binary recoding (1 = torture is never justifiable; undecideds removed).
recode trrtort ///
    (1/2 = 1 "Never justifiable") ///
    (4/5 = 0 "Sometimes justifiable") ///
    (3 = .) (else = .), gen(torture)
la var torture "Opposition to torture"

* Average opposition to torture in the European sample.
fre torture
tab torture [aw = dweight * pweight] // weighted by overall European population

* Average opposition to torture in each country sample.
gr dot torture [aw = dweight], over(cntry, sort(1) des) scale(.75) ///
    name(torture2, replace)

* Create a dummy for Israeli respondents.
gen israel:israel = (cntry == "IL")
la def israel 1 "Israel" 0 "Not Israel"

* Estimate DV proportions in Israel.
svy: prop torture if israel

* Compare average opposition to torture inside and outside Israel.
prtest torture, by(israel)

* Subset to respondents in Israel.
keep if israel

* Final sample size.
count

* Note that the sample is deliberately not representative of the general
* population of Israel. We took that step when we dropped respondents who did
* not provide a political placement or an income measure, and again when we
* removed neutral answers (the "neither-or" response item) to the original
* survey question. To work on a representative sample, you would need to keep
* all observations and apply survey weights (which were corrected in August 2013
* after it emerged that the original data contained faulty weights for Israel).
* A further and more advanced step would be to impute missing values of income.

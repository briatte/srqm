   F. Briatte and I. Petev

 - TOPIC:  Sexual Partners in the United States

 - DATA:   U.S. General Social Survey (2010)
 
   What makes Americans likely to report high numbers of sexual partners in the
   last five years? What makes them more likely to report low numbers?
   
   For this session, all hypotheses are to be provided by the students.
   
   Last updated 2013-08-17.

* Keep only valid observations, excluding oblivious respondents.

* =====================
* = REGRESSION MODELS =
* =====================


* A simple linear regression model test.
reg sxp i.female

* Let's add some of our control variables one by one. Let's first control for
* income: is higher income associated with a higher number of partners?
reg sxp i.female coninc

* Let's transform income into a more meaningful scale: a dollar change in income
* is not enough to have a large effect. Let's measure income to 10,000s of USD.
gen inc = coninc / 10^4

* Regress again.
reg sxp i.female inc

* Let's control for education as well.
reg sxp i.female inc educ

* Let's control for urban size.
reg sxp i.female inc educ size

* How about working status?
reg sxp i.female inc educ size i.wrkstat
fre wrkstat

* Let's add a control for marital status.
reg sxp i.female inc educ size i.wrkstat i.marital
fre marital

* Finally, let's control for age.
reg sxp i.female inc educ size i.wrkstat i.marital age

                 
* Reinterpretation of the constant
* --------------------------------

* Lastly, the constant reflects the value of y when the IVs are equal to the
* reference category for the categorical IVs (i.e., males, full-time employment,
* married) or 0 for the continuous IVs (income = 0, education = 0, age = 0, size = 0).
* However, often for continuous variables, as in this case, the 0 category is
* unlikely (educ = 0 and income = 0) or unreal (age = 0 and size = 0). Therefore, the
* constant is not meaningful and interpretable. In such cases, it's best to
* recode your continuous IVs so that their mean is equal to 0, making the
* reference category for the constant the sample mean for each continuous IV.
* To do so, we simply nead to substract from each variable its mean.

su inc
gen zinc = inc - r(mean)

su size
gen zsize = size - r(mean)

su age
gen zage = age - r(mean)

su educ
gen zeduc = educ - r(mean)

* Replicate the final regression model with transformed continuous variables.
reg sxp i.female zinc zeduc zsize i.wrkstat i.marital zage

* The results do not change except for the constant. For this model, the constant
* stands for the average number of partners among respondents who are:
* - Male (female = 0)
* - With average income (zinc = 0)
* - With average education (...)
* - From a mid-sized town
* - Employed full-time
* - Married
* - Mid-age


* Standardized coefficients
* -------------------------

* Model with metric coefficients (in units of each variable).
reg sxp i.female zinc zeduc zsize i.wrkstat i.marital zage

* Model with all coefficients expressed in standard deviation units.
reg sxp i.female zinc zeduc zsize i.wrkstat i.marital zage, b
